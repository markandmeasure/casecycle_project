# CaseCycle Project

This repository contains a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.

## Frontend

The React app resides in the `frontend` directory. It includes a single page with a **Fetch Opportunities** button that requests `/opportunities` from the backend.

### Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Backend

All backend commands assume you are in the repository root (where `main.py` and `populate_sample_data.py` live) and that each command is run **on its own line**.

### Setup and tests

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest                       # should report 7 passed
```

### Start the API

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Leave this terminal open; `uvicorn` must keep running. In a **second terminal** verify the health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/healthcheck
```

If this returns `{"status": "ok"}`, the backend is running correctly. A 404 usually means another process is still bound to portÂ 8000 or the server was started from a different directory. You can look for lingering processes with `lsof -i:8000` and stop them before restarting `uvicorn`.

### Sample data

Populate the database with example opportunities:

```bash
python populate_sample_data.py
```

Running the script is safe to repeat; each opportunity is upserted so duplicates are not created. Alternatively, the script runs automatically when the server starts if the `ENVIRONMENT` environment variable is set to `development`:

```bash
ENVIRONMENT=development uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Troubleshooting

### Frontend shows "Unable to fetch opportunities"

This message appears when the request to `/opportunities/` fails or returns something other than JSON.

1. Verify the backend is running and `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/opportunities/` returns a JSON array.
2. Check the browser developer tools (Network tab) for the request details. A 404 usually means the server was started from the wrong directory or a proxy is misconfigured.
3. Make sure no leftover `uvicorn` processes are using port 8000; stop them with `lsof -i:8000` followed by `kill <PID>` if needed.
