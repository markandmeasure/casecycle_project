# CaseCycle Frontend

This React application provides a simple interface to the CaseCycle FastAPI backend.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

On load, the single page requests `/opportunities/` from the backend and displays the JSON response.
