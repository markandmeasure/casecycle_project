# CaseCycle Frontend

This React application provides a simple interface to the CaseCycle FastAPI backend.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The single page includes a **Fetch Opportunities** button which requests `/opportunities` from the backend and displays the JSON response.
